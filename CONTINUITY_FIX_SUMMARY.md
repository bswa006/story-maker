# Story Continuity System - Fix Summary

## Problem
The user reported a 400 error with "image_generation_user_error" when trying to generate images with the new story continuity system.

## Root Cause
DALL-E 3 was rejecting prompts that contained structured formatting with brackets like `[STORY CONTINUITY - Page 1/10]`. The API expects natural language prompts without such metadata markers.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Natural Language Conversion** (`continuity-enhanced-prompts.ts`)
- Removed all bracketed headers like `[STORY CONTINUITY]`, `[CHARACTER CONSISTENCY]`, etc.
- Converted to natural language: "Page 1 of 10 in a fantasy children's story..."
- Added cleanup to remove any remaining brackets: `.replace(/\[.*?\]/g, '')`
- Removed "SCENE:" prefix that could be problematic
- Fixed art style formatting: `artStyle.replace(/_/g, ' ')` to convert "studio_ghibli" to "studio ghibli"

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling** (`generate-images-v2/route.ts`)
- Added detailed error logging for DALL-E API errors
- Added pattern detection for problematic content:
  - Bracketed content `[...]`
  - Curly braces `{...}`
  - Non-ASCII characters
  - Multiple newlines
- This helps diagnose future prompt issues quickly

### 3. **Build Error Fixes**
- Removed unused imports and variables that were causing TypeScript errors
- Cleaned up unused `progressiveContext` variable
- Fixed import statements to only include used functions

## Testing
Created `test-continuity.js` script to test the continuity system with:
- Multi-page story generation
- Character consistency tracking
- Art style application
- Error reporting

## Expected Results
- Images should now generate successfully without 400 errors
- Character appearance should remain consistent across pages
- Story settings and atmosphere should be maintained
- Visual style should be coherent throughout the story

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the server
2. Execute `node test-continuity.js` to verify the fix
3. Monitor the console output for any remaining issues
4. Test with different art styles to ensure compatibility
